# Yelp Search API Interface

A simple prototype that fetches yelp results based on the query parameters in the url and renders them into HTML

A sample query string might be:

    ?term=korean&location=newyork&limit=10 

Additional Yelp search parameters can be found here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api
